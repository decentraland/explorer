          <p>
            1.1 This Privacy Policy details important information regarding the
            collection, use and disclosure of User information collected on the
            Site and the Tools. The aim of this Privacy Policy is to help you
            understand how your personal information is used and your choices
            regarding said use. By using the Site or the Tools, you agree that
            the Foundation can collect, use, disclose, and process your
            information as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy
            only applies to the Site and the Tools, and not to any other
            websites, products or services you may be able to access or link to
            via the Site or the Tools. We encourage you to read the privacy
            policies of any other websites you visit before providing your
            information to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Site and the Tools may evolve over time, and this Privacy Policy
            will change to reflect that evolution. If changes are made, you will
            be notified by revising the date at the top of this Privacy Policy.
            In some cases, if significant changes are made, an statement may be
            placed in the homepage. We encourage you to review this Privacy
            Policy periodically to stay informed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some third-party providers may place cookies or pixels - small data
            files stored on your hard drive or in device memory - on your
            browser or hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy does not cover
            the use of cookies or pixels by such third parties. Most web
            browsers are set to accept cookies and pixels by default, but you
            can usually set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies or
            pixels. If you do choose to remove or reject cookies or pixels,
            however, your ability to use the Site or the Tools might be
            affected.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.2 This Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with the Terms
            of Use. By accessing the Tools, you are consenting to the
            information collection and use practices described in this Privacy
            Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.3 Your use of the DCL Client and any personal information you
            provide through the Tools remains subject to the terms of this
            Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, as each may be updated from
            time to time.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.4 Any questions, comments or complaints that you might have should
            be emailed to privacy@decentraland.org.
          </p>
          <p>2. Information Collected in the Site and the Tools</p>
          <p>
            The personal information collected from you generally may include:
          </p>
          <p>
            2.1 Network information regarding transactions, including, among
            other things, the type of device you use, access times, hardware
            model, operating system and version, and other unique device
            identifiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            2.2. Information about plugins you might be using, included but not
            limited to those related to the management of cryptocurrency assets
            and any information provided by them.
          </p>
          <p>2.3. Your email and Ether address.</p>
          <p>
            2.4 The DCL Client requires the highest level of browser permissions
            that could potentially lead to procurement of more personal
            information. Information on these permissions are used for a limited
            purpose, and why this is necessary, can be found in paragraph 3
            below.
          </p>
          <p>
            2.5 Your interactions with the Site are documented via Segment.io
            and that information is processed by Google.
          </p>
          <p>3. The Way your Personal Information is used</p>
          <p>
            3.1 As with nearly all interactions that take place on the World
            Wide Web, the servers may receive information by virtue of your
            interaction with them, including but not limited to IP Addresses.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.2 The DCL Client requires full browser permissions that could
            potentially be used to access additional personal information. Such
            browser permissions are used for an extremely limited technical
            purpose for allowing the DCL Client to properly interact with your
            browser. No additional information is obtained beyond what is
            necessary to provide the DCL Client. No information received is
            shared with any third-party except as required for provision of the
            DCL Client.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.3 Segment.io is used for purposes of monitoring web traffic. Any
            identifying information collected via Segment.io is controlled by
            Segment.io, Inc.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.4 Public blockchains provide transparency into transactions and
            the Foundation is not responsible for preventing or managing
            information broadcasted on a blockchain.
          </p>
          <p>4. What Is Done With Your Information</p>
          <p>4.1 Your information may be used in the following ways:</p>
          <p>To analyze trends for how the Site and Tools are being used;</p>
          <p>To improve the Site and the Tools;</p>
          <p>
            To help personalize your experience of the Site and the Tools; and
          </p>
          <p>
            If you provide your contact information, you may receive technical
            notices, updates, confirmations, security alerts, to provide support
            to you, to tell you about other products and services that might
            interest you, or to respond to your comments or questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.2 Your information may be shared with third parties who need to
            access it in order to do work related to the Site and the Tools,
            including doing things like helping make the Site or DCL Client
            available, or providing analytics services. These third parties only
            access and use your information as necessary to perform their
            functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.3 Aggregations and anonymizations that contain your information
            may be created in a way that does not directly identify you. Those
            aggregations and anonymizations may be used or shared for a variety
            of purposes related to the Site and the DCL Client.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.4 Your personal information may be disclosed to agents,
            businesses, or service providers who process your personal
            information for providing the Site and the Tools to you. The
            agreements with these service providers limit the kinds of
            information they can use or process and ensure they use reasonable
            efforts to keep your personal information secure.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.5 The Foundation also reserves the right to disclose personal
            information that it believes, in good faith, is appropriate or
            necessary to enforce the Terms of Use, take precautions against
            liability or harm, to investigate and respond to third-party claims
            or allegations, to respond to court orders or official requests, to
            protect the security or integrity of the Site or the Tools, and to
            protect the rights, property, or safety of the Foundation, the
            Decentraland community of users and LAND owners, or others.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.6 In the event that the Foundation is involved in a merger,
            acquisition, sale, bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
            receivership, assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the
            application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’
            rights generally, or other change of control, there may be a
            disclosure of your information to another entity related to such
            event.
          </p>
          <p>5. Your Choice</p>
          <p>
            Your personal information will be processed in accordance with this
            Privacy Policy, and as part of that you will have limited or no
            opportunity to otherwise modify how your information is used.
          </p>
          <p>6. Cookies</p>
          <p>
            The Site and the Tools do not use cookies at this time but they
            might do so in the future, in which case this Privacy Policy shall
            be updated accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>7. Information Not Collected</p>
          <p>
            Any other personally-identifiable information about you shall not be
            collected, unless you give it to the Foundation directly: by filling
            out a form, giving written feedback, communicating via third party
            social media sites, or otherwise communicating via the Site, the
            Tools or any other means.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your Ethereum public address is not collected, but you should
            understand that transactions that take place using the Site and the
            Tools are confirmed and managed via the Ethereum blockchain. You
            understand that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly
            visible whenever you engage in a transaction that is confirmed and
            managed via the Ethereum blockchain.
          </p>
          <p>8. Information Security</p>
          <p>
            Whilst neither the Foundation, nor any other organization, can
            guarantee the security of information processed online, the
            Foundation has appropriate security measures in place to protect
            your personal information. For example, the personal information you
            provide is stored on computer systems with limited access,
            encryption, or both.
          </p>
          <p>9. Privacy Rights</p>
          <p>
            9.1 Subject to applicable law, you may have some or all of the
            following rights in respect of your personal information: (i) to
            obtain a copy of your personal information together with information
            about how and on what basis that personal information is processed;
            (ii) to rectify inaccurate personal information (including the right
            to have incomplete personal information completed); (iii) to erase
            your personal information (in limited circumstances, where it is no
            longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was
            collected or processed); (iv) to restrict processing of your
            personal information where: a. the accuracy of the personal
            information is contested; b. the processing is unlawful but you
            object to the erasure of the personal information; or c. we no
            longer require the personal information but it is still required for
            the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim; (v) to
            challenge processing which we have justified on the basis of a
            legitimate interest (as opposed to your consent, or to perform a
            contract with you); (vi) to prevent us from sending you direct
            marketing; (vii) to withdraw your consent to our processing of your
            personal information (where that processing is based on your
            consent); (viii) to object to decisions which are based solely on
            automated processing or profiling; (ix) in addition to the above,
            you have the right to file a complaint with the supervisory
            authority.
          </p>
          <p>
            9.2. If you reside in California, you may request certain general
            information regarding our disclosure of personal information to
            third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
