# Decentraland Explorer

## Contributing

**Please read the [contribution guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)**

### Before you start

1. [Pull Request Naming Standards](https://github.com/decentraland/standards/blob/master/standards/git-usage.md)
2. [Architecture Overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_lzi3V5IDaVRJbTKNsNEcaG0L21VPydiUx5uamiyQnY/edit)
3. [Coding Guidelines](unity-client/style-guidelines.md)

This repo requires `git lfs` to track images and other binary files. https://git-lfs.github.com/ and the latest version of GNU make, install it using `brew install make`
If you are using Windows 10 we recommend you to enable the Linux subsystem and install a Linux distro from Windows Store like Ubuntu. Then install all tools and dependecies like nodejs, npm, typescript, make...

## Running the kernel

Make sure you have the following dependencies:
- Node v10 or compatible installed via `sudo apt install nodejs`
- yarn installed globally via `sudo npm install yarn -g`

IMPORTANT: If your path has spaces the build process will fail. Make sure to clone this repo in a properly named path. 

Build the project:

    cd kernel
    npm install
    make build-essentials

To run and watch a server with the kernel build, run:

    make watch

Optionally, you can build the test scenes which are used in `debug` mode:

    make test-scenes

To run the Unity interface:

1. Download and install Unity 2019.1.14f1 or a later 2019.1 version (note that 2019.2 does not work!)
2. Open the Initial Scene
3. Run the Initial Scene in the Unity editor!

To run the client in `debug` mode append the following query parameter to the URL:

    http://localhost:8080/?DEBUG_MODE

To run the client in first person perspective append the following query parameter to the URL:

    http://localhost:8080/?DEBUG_MODE&fps

To spawn in a specific set of coordinates append the following query paramter:

    http://localhost:8080/?DEBUG_MODE&fps&position=10,10

## Running tests

To see test logs/errors directly in the browser, run:

    make watch

Now, navigate to [http://localhost:8080/test](http://localhost:8080/test)

### Kernel Visual tests

Visual tests are meant to work in a similar way as `snapshot tests`. Each time a test parcel changes the author is required to commit new screenshots along the other changes. These screenshots are then validated to detect regressions at the time of the pull request. To generate new snapshot images to compare run `npm run test:dry` (it requires docker)

### Test parcels

It is possible to define new parcels inside this repo for testing purposes. To do so, create a new folder in `public/test-scenes`. There are several conventions to be followed regarding the name of these folders and the positions of the parcels, these can be found in the [README](https://github.com/decentraland/client/blob/master/public/test-scenes/README.md) file.

To edit and make sure that `make watch` is rebuilding the scene when you are hacking on a new feature of the kernel, make sure to modify `targets/scenes/basic-scenes.json` and point to the scene you're working on.

All test parcels can be accessed inside visual tests:

```ts
import { loadTestParcel } from 'test/testHelpers'

describe('My example test', function() {
  loadTestParcel(200, 10)
  // ...
```

### Unity Editor debugging with dcl scene in "preview mode"

1. Run 'dcl start' to open the scene in preview mode. Leave the server running and close the newly-opened browser tab
2. In Unity Editor, in the "InitialScene" scene, select the WSSController gameobject and untoggle the "Open Browser When Start", and toggle the "Use client debug mode". (Make sure the SceneController has the "Debug Scenes" toggle OFF)
3. In Unity Editor hit PLAY
4. In a new browser tab go to http://localhost:8000/?UNITY_ENABLED=true&DEBUG_MODE&LOCAL_COMMS&position=0%2C-1&ws=ws%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A5000%2Fdcl
5. Go back to unity and the scene should start loading in there almost immediately

### DCL scene in preview mode using a local explorer version

1. In the explorer repo directory, run a `make watch` or `make dev-watch` once
2. Kill the server and run `make initialize-ecs-npm-link`
3. In the scene directory run `npm link decentraland-ecs`
4. In the scene directory run `dcl start` and it should already be using the local version of the client

### Unity Assembly Definition Files

To be able to use the Test libraries for unit testing, we are using several [Assembly Definition Files](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptCompilationAssemblyDefinitionFiles.html):

#### MainScripts.asmdef

This assembly contains all of our custom classes and scripts (which must stay inside its directory or in its hierarchy below).

#### Other .asmdef files

On every component directory there is a /test folder with an assembly definition file marked as a test assembly so that it gets stripped when building the project and references the test libraries for assertions. Also, these .asmdef files reference the MainScripts.asmdef to be able to have our own classes available at unit tests code.

### Component implementation high-level guidelines

Before implementing a component on unity's side, it's recommended to check in the [explorer](https://github.com/decentraland/explorer) repo for the same component and verify whether it is a Disposable/Shared component or not, as their implementation pipeline differs.
Every component declaration should be under the **/packages/decentraland-ecs/src/decentraland/** directory (Be aware that your IDE may find the component also in a ".ts" script, dismiss those declarations as they correspond to interfaces for the components in typescript).

#### Entity/Non-Shared/Non-Disposable component:

- Make sure the corresponding CLASS_ID_COMPONENT value exists in MainScripts/DCL/Models/Protocol.cs, otherwise add it.
- Create the component script and prefab in MainScripts/DCL/Components/[Corresponding Folder]/
- From the Unity editor, update the MainScripts/DCL/Factory/DCLComponentFactory scriptable object adding the new element in the Factory List with the correct CLASS_ID_COMPONENT value and its prefab reference

#### Shared/Disposable component:

- Make sure the corresponding CLASS_ID value exists in MainScripts/DCL/Models/Protocol.cs, otherwise add it.
- Create the component script in MainScripts/DCL/Components/[Corresponding Folder]/
- Edit the SharedComponentCreate() method in MainScripts/DCL/Controllers/Scene/ParcelScene.cs to make sure it instantiates the new shared component.

### Shaders Scene-Forced PreWarm

To avoid extremely slow building times due to the Lightweight Render Pipeline shader variants compilation (LWRP shaders can't be packed in a 'shadervariants' file), we are using scene-instanced objects under the Environment/ShadersPrewarm/ prefab to force unity to pre-load them and be ready for using them on the fly. Please do not delete these objects.

### GLTF Dynamic Loading

We are using [UnityGLTF](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/UnityGLTF) as a Dynamic GLTF/GLB loader for unity to handle GLTF models.

#### Local changes made to UnityGLTF plugin

##### NOTE: UnityGLTF plugin update is discouraged until Unity WebGL supports multi-threading

1. GLTFComponent.cs has been adapted to:

- Be able to avoid loading on start by default (for remotely-fetched models that need to take some time to download)
- Have a 'finished loading asset callback' providing the time it took to load the GLTF asset (initially used for measuring loading times)
- StartCoroutine has been replaced by StartThrowingCoroutine so we catch the invalid GLTF assets gracefully.

2. SpecGlossMap.cs and MetalRoughMap.cs were adapted to use "Lightweight Render Pipeline/Simple Lit" and "Lightweight Render Pipeline/Lit" shaders respectively (the original PbrMetallicRoughness and PbrSpecularGlossiness don't work with the Lightweight Render Pipeline)

3. Several files were modified to replce Tasks (multi-threading) with Coroutines as Unity WebGL build doesn't support multi-threading.

4. Animation curve processing methods were adapted to be spread through many frames.

5. GameObject reparenting is made as soon the root GLTF loading object is created, so a big mesh can be seen in place before the loading finished.

### Client Visual Tests Pipeline

#### How to create them

1. Create a new test class that inherits from VisualTestsBase
2. Initialize the visual tests using `VisualTestsBase.InitVisualTestsScene(string)` passing the test name as parameter
3. Setup your scene as wanted and call `TestHelpers.TakeSnapshot(Vector3)`
4. Tag the method with the attribute `[VisualTest]`. This isn't used yet but will be used to streamline the baseline images creation.

The pngs will be named automatically using the `InitVisualTestsScene` parameter.

Example:

```
public class VisualTests : VisualTestsBase
{
    [UnityTest][VisualTest]
    public IEnumerator VisualTestStub()
    {
        yield return InitVisualTestsScene("VisualTestStub");

        // Set up scene

        yield return VisualTestHelpers.TakeSnapshot(new Vector3(10f, 10f, 0f));
    }
}
```

#### How to create visual tests baseline images

1. Create a new test inside the same class of the desired visual test. Give it the same name followed by `_Generate`.
2. call `VisualTestHelpers.GenerateBaselineForTest(IEnumerator)` inside the method, passing the actual test method as parameter.
3. remember to make the test `[Explicit]` or the test will give false positives

Example:

```
[UnityTest][Explicit]
public IEnumerator VisualTestStub_Generate()
{
    yield return VisualTestHelpers.GenerateBaselineForTest(VisualTestStub());
}
```

### Making a manual build

1. Build unity WASM with its name as `unity` into the folder `/static`. **It's very important that the folder/build name is `unity`**.
2. Checkout the file named `static/unity/Build/DCLUnityLoader.js`. Unity deletes anything on this folder as part of the build process and we need that.

```
git checkout -- static/unity/Build/DCLUnityLoader.js
```

4. Checkout the modifications in the `static/unity/Build/unity.json` file. Unity deletes our custom changes as part of the build process.

```
git checkout -- static/unity/Build/unity.json
```

5. Run `make watch`.
6. Testing how your new build performs:

- Open **[http://localhost:8080/?DEBUG_MODE&LOCAL_COMMS&position=-100,100](http://localhost:8080/?DEBUG_MODE&LOCAL_COMMS&position=-100,100)** to go to an area with a high density of test parcels.
- Open **[http://localhost:8080/?DEBUG_MODE&LOCAL_COMMS&ENV=org&position=10,0](http://localhost:8080/?DEBUG_MODE&LOCAL_COMMS&ENV=org&position=10,0)** to open an area with real-life deployments (but without communicating with other users).
- Open **[http://localhost:8080/?ENV=org&position=0,90](http://localhost:8080/?ENV=org&position=0,90)** to open the explorer near the Decentraland Museum

### Builder Integration

The following layers were created for builder functionality:
-Ground: used to facilitate ground raycasting and objects movement-
-Gizmo: used to identify the gizmos and effects.
-Selected: used for selected object effects.

### Native Kernel-Renderer Interface

In some cases, using `SendMessage` is not performant enough to pass data
from Kernel to the Unity Renderer. To address that we added a new native
bridge that ends up giving JS the ability to call C# methods directly.

The following files are involved

* *kernelNativeBridge.c / .h:* Here lies the glue between C# and JS. A
  few macros have been defined to define methods that will be exposed
  from JS and C# in order to pass the function pointers that we need to
  make the direct calls.

* *EntryPoint_World.cs:* Here, the `SetCallback` methods defined in
  `kernelNativeBridge` have to be called in order to have a C# method
  recognized and callable by JS.

* *nativeMessagesBridge.ts*: In this file we are initializing the
  JS-side call methods.

#### Step by step guide to add a new direct call function

* Add the function in the `kernelNativeBridge.c` file. This just
  involves adding `EXTERNAL_CALLBACK_<signature>(<method-name>)` line to
  the file. Note that the signature has to be specified.

* If the method
  has a signature not defined yet, you have to add a new macro that
  should use a new function pointer type declared in
  `kernelNativeBridge.h`. This macro will generate the
  `SetCallback_<method-name>` and `call<method-name>` functions used
  later.

* Bind the function in `EntryPoint_World.cs`. For this you will need the
  method signature delegate. Again, if the signature is new, you'll have
  to create a new one. When you have the delegate, you have to define a
  static method, looking like this:
  ```
    [MonoPInvokeCallback(typeof(JS_Delegate_VS))]
    private static void Foo(string id)
    {
        //your code
    }
  ```
  Remember, the method has to be static and has to use the
  `MonoPInvokeCallback` attribute with the proper delegate. Otherwise,
  compilation will fail and the methods will not be bound correctly.

* Put the `SetCallback_Foo` call in `World_EntryPoint` initialization
  with the method as a param. This will set the function pointer wasm
  side, finishing the "glue" between C# and JS.
  ```
    public EntryPoint_World(SceneController sceneController)
    {
        ...
        SetCallback_Foo(Foo);
  ```

*  Now you have to call the method. This example code would call the
   `Foo` method from JS. Remember that you need the `Module` instance
   that lies inside the unity instance JS side returned by the
   `UnityLoader` construct. Right now, this is already solved in
   `nativeMessagesBridge.ts`. The following example should add the `Foo`
   method to it.

   ```
   private callFoo!: (arg: string) => void
   ...
   public initNativeMessages(gameInstance: any) {
    ...
    this.callFoo = this.unityModule.cwrap('call_Foo', null, ['string'])
    ...
   }
   ```

   And later...

   ```
   this.callFoo("bar") // finally calling the function
   ```

* We did it!. Remember: this is no replacement of `SendMessage`.
  `SendMessage` is still used by our WSS debug mode. So, you'll have to
  always provide a `SendMessage` alternative and bind it correctly to
  our `WSSController`. From Kernel, you can branch between native and
  `SendMessage` calls using a snippet like this:
  ```
    if (WSS_ENABLED || FORCE_SEND_MESSAGE) {
      // SendMessage
    } else {
      // Native call
    }
  ```

* As you can see, binding native calls has a lot of maintenance costs,
  so its better to just bind calls that really need that performance
  speed up. If you need benchmarks, this approach is inspired by
  [this](https://forum.unity.com/threads/super-fast-javascript-interaction-on-webgl.382734/)
  unity forum post showing some numbers.


## Creating a typescript Worker in Kernel
You can check the files used for our simple gif-processor worker (`packages/gif-processor`):
1. Create relevant folder inside `packages/` and put a .ts file for the main thread and another .ts for the worker (gif-processor example: `processor.ts` and `worker.ts`)
2. copy the tsconfig.json file from `packages/gif-processor` into the new folder, rename and edit its "OutDir" value to point to a new folder inside `/static/`
3. Duplicate the `targets/engine/gif-processor.json` file, rename it and change its "file" value to point to your worker .ts file
4. Inside the `Makefile` file create a new path constant (like the one for `GIF_PROCESSOR`) and set the path to your compiled worker file (the folder you created in step 2 plus 'worker.ts'). Then add that new constant inside `build-essentials` like `GIF_PROCESSOR`
5. Inside the `Makefile` add the following 2 lines with your own paths:
```
static/gif-processor/worker.js: packages/gif-processor/*.ts
	@$(COMPILER) targets/engine/gif-processor.json
```
6. You should be able to import your package that uses the Worker anywhere. Beware of the [limitations when passing data to/from workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm) and also consider [passing the data as Transferable objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Transferable) to improve performance.
